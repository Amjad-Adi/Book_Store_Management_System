This is a C-based Book Store Management System that allows users to manage a catalog of books stored in a file.

 The program supports adding, removing, searching, printing, and saving books with their name, bin number (ID), and price.

Books are stored in three parallel arrays:
- `char names[MAXSIZE][NAMESIZE]` for names  
- `int bins[MAXSIZE]` for bin numbers  
- `double prices[MAXSIZE]` for prices  

The book records are maintained in sorted order based on bin numbers using binary search for efficient lookup.
